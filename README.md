AI Agent
This project is an AI-powered research and recipe assistant built using Flask, LangChain, and Ionic React. The backend leverages Flask to handle API requests and integrates LangChain's AgentExecutor to process queries by fetching Wikipedia summaries for research and recipe details from the Spoonacular API.

The application prioritizes Spoonacular images when available and dynamically generates images using OpenAI’s DALL·E if needed. The Ionic-based frontend ensures a seamless user experience by retrieving research and recipe data through Axios API calls, displaying structured information in expandable sections for summary, ingredients, instructions, and clickable sources.

To enhance usability, the app automatically manages data visibility, logs debugging responses, and guarantees responsive UI updates, making it an intelligent and user-friendly solution for instant research and culinary guidance.
